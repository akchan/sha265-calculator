# SHA265 Calculator

This app calculates a hash of given text using the SHA-256 algorithm. You can always get same hash from same text. But it is very difficult to estimate original text from hash.

For example, you can use SHA256 Calculator for anonimization of IDs.

# Usage

1. Download `sha256_calculator.html`.
1. Just open `sha256_calculator.html` with your web browser!

# Dependency

Hash calculation depends on jsSHA which is a JavaScript implementation of the SHA family.

To check whether SHA256 Calculator gives a jcorrect hash or not, the validation program will be run whenever it starts up.
